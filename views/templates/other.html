    Idea for post: Relativity elevators with balls shooting from top to bottom. That visual really stuck with me. And you can't know whether you're accelerating or at rest; they're only relative notions (to a frame of reference; i.e. no such thing as accelerating full stop). Would be super cool to draw clocks with hands moving at the appropriate speeds.

      I have always been troubled by <i>Matrix</i>-esque skeptical scenarios: What if I'm dreaming? What if a demon god is controlling all of my experiences to delude me into believing that there are physical objects? (This is the more flavorful hypothesis Descartes puts forward in the <i>Meditations</i>.)
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      But recently I have begun to wonder <i>why</i> I have found these hypotheses so disconcerting. What's the alternative &mdash; that physical objects are composed of clumps of balls that are surrounded (at a huge distance, relative to their size) by tiny specks of electricity, and that our conscious experiences emerge out of the coordinated actions of billions of tiny sperm-shaped cells?
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      While it's of course true that the declarations of science have a different standing than the Evil Demon God hypothesis, it isn't at at clear that this difference amounts to the latter failing to provide some <i>certain guarantee</i> that the former offers.

    <div class="blogText">
      I recently had the pleasure of playing the role of the Table Topics speaker at our weekly Toastmasters meeting. For our topic I chose the idea of beauty.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      The concept seems at once ubiquitous and nebulous. As easily as it comes to my lips, so stubbornly does the thought it expresses resist clarification. I find it difficult to translate my thought into language not containing the word 'beauty'.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      It helps to have something concrete to ground our reflection. One of my favorite poems, Rilke's <i>Archaic Torso of Apollo</i>, has the advantage that in addition to being a beautiful poem, it is also in many ways <i>about</i> the experience of beauty.
    </div>

    <div class="poem" layout layout-align="center center">
      <pre class="poem">
        We cannot know his legendary head
        with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
        is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
        like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,

        gleams in all its power. Otherwise
        the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could
        a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
        to that dark center where procreation flared.

        Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
        beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
        and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:

        would not, from all the borders of itself,
        burst like a star: for here there is no place
        that does not see you. You must change your life.</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Indeed, beauty "dazzles" and transfixes us. It combines an inviting smile with a retreating dark center, a felt brilliance with a displaced and unknown head. The experience of beauty demands to be recorded, and yet with equal intensity it refuses to be ensnared, trapped on the page or in the mind. It has a quality of <i>aliveness</i>; it "glisten[s] like a wild beast's fur."
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Beauty invites us to <i>see</i>, but also stimulates us to try to see ourselves seeing. It compels us to reflect on why we are so moved, to try and catch ourselves in the moment of rapt attention and pin that moment to our corkboard, like a preserved butterfly. Beauty is powerful, and we feel impelled to investigate the sources of its power. We are pushed into a kind of sine wave between wanting to see, to inhale the beauty, and wanting to understand why it moves us.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      This idea calls to mind the etymology of 'aesthetics'. Beauty is tethered to what the Greeks called &alpha;&iota;&sigma;&theta;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; (<i>aistheisis</i>), or sense-perception. We're tempted to think of beauty as living only on the emotional side of the mind/passions dichotomy. But can we really understand the idea of beauty without accounting for the intellectual experience, the quest to understand and organize, occasioned by a feeling of beauty?
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Rilke cashes out the interplay between the intellectual and emotional/perceptual aspects of beauty in ethical terms. The imperative that concludes the poem arrives abruptly, and yet we feel somehow prepared for it. Much of the conclusion's force can be traced to the way in which the earlier aesthetic musings manage to pry open a certain emotional part of the reader, preparing her for contact with the ethical dimension.

                <h2 class="blogTitle">Greek Tragedy: On Becoming Oneself</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="blogSubtitle">
                Jan. 14, 2018
              </div>
            </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          Greek tragedy is like pop culture: both are ever-relevant living documents. The difference is that 'pop culture' is alive and relevant because it's indexed to time &mdash; we feel entitled to ask, "The 'pop' of <i>when</i>?". Greek tragedy, on the other hand, affects us with its depth of concern, its intensity of feeling, its sheer power to <i>endure</i> through time.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          Two of my favorite tragedies are Euripides' <i>Bacchae</i> and Sophocles' <i>Oedipus Rex</i>. Both focus on self-knowledge: the barriers to it, and the dangers and benefits that accompany its (gradual) attainment. Both (like many tragedies) deal with questions of fate, agency, and the desire to know oneself.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          <i>Oedipus</i> provides the clearer example. When he's born, Oedipus (<i>spoiler alert!</i>) is prophesized to marry his mother and kill his father. Upon hearing the prophecy, his father (Laius, king of Thebes) wants to eliminate Oedipus; but his mother, warm-hearted, entrusts the baby to a Theban shepherd.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          Oedipus grows up in another city. At one point he hears of the prophecy. Horrified at the idea of fulfilling it, he abandons the home of the people he takes to be his parents. Long story short, in his effort to avoid the prophecy, Oedipus ends up fulfilling it. On learning the truth, he blinds himself.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          The play takes the form of a detective story, in which Oedipus (current king of Thebes) searches for his father's murderer &mdash; which turns out to be himself. Many other characters &mdash; his mother/wife Jocasta, the shepherd who cared for him as a baby &mdash; try to dissuade Oedipus from discovering the truth, but he is relentless.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          Why should such a courageous pursuit of his own origin result in Oedipus's self-blinding? Why should his desire to see lead to his self-imposed darkness?
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          To answer this, we have to consider Sophocles' larger arc for Oedipus. In the sequel, <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, Oedipus (aided by his daughter Antigone) achieves a kind of salvation. He gains the freedom to decide the fate of his traitorous sons; he attains an almost-divine status by the play's conclusion.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          Before he could arrive at this humbled state, Oedipus had to endure the pain of learning about his origins, his identity. But still, it's strange that Oedipus' submission to Fate &mdash; blinding himself in order to escape its power &mdash; turns out to be a necessary condition for exercising real agency. This is the puzzle that interests me.
        </div>
<br>
        <div layout layout-align="center center">
          <b>*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</b>
        </div>
<br>
        <div class="blogText">
          Turning to the <i>Bacchae</i> might provide an angle onto this question, of why fate and freedom are so inextricably bound together in Oedipus' case (and throughout Greek tragedy). This story also takes place in Thebes, many years earlier. Dionysus, or Bacchus, has returned to the city after recruiting a fleet of women (from the East) to exact revenge for his mother's exile. She was exiled for claiming her child was a god (a child of Zeus); so naturally, Dionysus' goal is to prove his divine power.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          Enter King Pentheus, whose combination of inexperience and arrogance perfectly encapsulates youth. He stands for order, adherence to social norms, imprisonment, consistency. The central clash of the play is between Pentheus and Dionysus, who is impersonating a priest (of Dionysus).
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          Dionysus is cited as god of many things: wine, revelry, revelation, masks, forgetting, oblivion. One way of understanding Dionysus' <i>divinity</i> is that we cannot understand human nature without accounting for <i>Dionysian</i> forces, influences, traits. Pentheus initially rejects these elements of humanity, but ultimately proves to be voyeuristically curious.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          At one point, after warning Pentheus not to bind him, Dionysus analyzes Pentheus: "You do not know why you live, or what you are doing, or who you are" (505). This is pretty much borne out: Pentheus is destroyed by his unwillingness to accept or acknowledge certain psychic forces. Seen in a certain light, it is Pentheus' ignorance of himself, of what makes him a human, that catalyzes his demise.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          This prompts a preliminary answer to our question about Oedipus. He must paradoxically acknowledge his fate before he's freed, must see himself as he is before moving forward authentically in the world.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          This seems paradoxical because we find it natural (or at least I do) to think of a self as a function from situation to behavior. If your self is fixed, then given a certain input situation you'll return the expected output behavior. If someone knew all the facts about you and your situation, they could deduce what action you would take. And yet, it's Pentheus' unwillingness to acknowledge certain things about his nature that results in his destruction, and it's Oedipus' acknowledgement of those things that allows for his freedom and ultimate salvation.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          I guess the takeaway here is that it's a mistake to think that reflecting on our personal history and nature will only serve to restrict our action. Rather than imposing constraints on our behavior, it turns out that reflecting on, engaging with and ultimately accepting certain facts about ourselves will enlarge and enrich our freedom to engage with the world.
        </div>

        <div class="blogText">
          It feels appropriate to conclude with a Spinoza quote: "The more clearly you understand yourself and your emotions, the more you become a lover of what is."

        <h2 class="blogTitle">Self-Conception as Carapace</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="blogSubtitle">
        Jan. 8, 2018
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      The distinction we sometimes naturally draw between behavior and identity &mdash; what one does and who one is &mdash; has always struck me as at best porous,  and at worst fraught.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Of course the distinction can be useful. For example, say John is accused of a sexist action. It's easier to accept this, psychologically, than to try to defend oneself against the charge of being a sexist.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      But I'm more interested in the ways in which this distinction can become dangerous, and perhaps be dissolved. It's easy to fall into thinking of an identity &mdash; a conception of onself (as e.g. artist, programmer, friend), or an affiliation with a group (family, nation, religion) &mdash; as a program for generating appropriate behavior. "I am a violinist, so I should play the violin; indeed, I must play in order to maintain my identity."
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      In the film <i>Brink</i>, the main character is counseled by his father: "Skating isn't who you are; skating is what you do." This is all well and good, and it likely planted the seeds for my thoughts early in life. But for the majority of my life, being a student wasn't something I did: it was who I was.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      So I can attest to the ways in which an identity, a certain self-conception, can become like a carapace. Like an insect's exoskeletal shell, an identity ("I am a student") can provide structure and guidance to one's behavior. It can also provide protection against possible assailants of one's motivation.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      But it can also become brittle, inhibiting one's growth and generating unhealthy expectations. Focusing on only one aspect of your identity can delude you; suddenly your worth seems to depend on that aspect alone. Suddenly only behaviors associated with that conception of yourself come naturally to you. Suddenly you are not sure who you are beyond being someone who plays that role.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      I grant this may seem melodramatic. Still, I think the core idea stands. Be yourself, and even be "yourself" &mdash; you as you conceive yourself to be &mdash; but don't be a prisoner to "yourself." Be yourself.
